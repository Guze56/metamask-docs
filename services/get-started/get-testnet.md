# Get testnet ETH and tokens

Use testnet tokens to test applications on blockchain networks without using real cryptocurrency. 
Testnet tokens allow you to simulate transactions, deploy smart contracts, and interact with dapps in a controlled environment.

## Avalanche (C-Chain)

Use the [FUJI faucet](https://faucet.avax-test.network/) to send testnet AVAX to your C-Chain address to use for testing purposes.

You can [connect your MetaMask wallet to the C-Chain](https://support.avax.network/en/articles/4626956-how-to-connect-metamask-to-avalanche).

## Blast

You can get Sepolia ETH for the Blast network from the [Quicknode Blast faucet](https://faucet.quicknode.com/blast/sepolia).

Alternatively, obtain Sepolia ETH from [the Infura faucet](https://www.infura.io/faucet/sepolia) and
[bridge](https://docs.blast.io/building/bridges/testnet) your funds to the Blast network.

## Celo

Use the [Celo faucet](https://celo.org/developers/faucet) to fund your wallet on the Alfajores network. Each request adds
1 CELO and 1 of each core stable token (cUSD, cEUR, cREAL).

You can [connect your MetaMask wallet to Celo ](https://docs.celo.org/wallet/metamask/use) or use a
[Celo wallet](https://docs.celo.org/wallet).

## Linea

:::caution Deprecation notice

Linea Goerli is being deprecated. We discourage new development with this testnet and recommend using
Linea Sepolia instead.

:::

We recommend using the [MetaMask](https://metamask.io/) wallet to store your funds. Use one of the following
faucets to obtain Linea Sepolia ETH:

- [Infura faucet](https://www.infura.io/faucet/linea)
- [Covalent faucet](https://www.covalenthq.com/faucet/)

Alternatively, you can obtain [Sepolia ETH](https://www.infura.io/faucet/sepolia) and
[bridge your funds](https://bridge.linea.build/) to the Linea Sepolia testnet.

See the [official Linea documentation](https://docs.linea.build/use-mainnet/bridges-of-linea/how-to-bridge-eth) for
information about additional faucets and bridging funds.

## Mantle

You need Sepolia ETH and Sepolia MNT to transact on the Sepolia Mantle testnet. To do this:

1. Obtain Sepolia ETH for the Mantle network from the
   [Infura Sepolia faucet](https://www.infura.io/faucet/sepolia), you can find a list
   of Sepolia ETH faucets on the [Faucetlink webpage](https://faucetlink.to/sepolia).

1. Obtain Sepolia MNT from the [Mantle testnet faucet](https://faucet.sepolia.mantle.xyz/). You need
   Sepolia ETH to mint your MNT tokens.

1. [Bridge your MNT tokens](https://bridge.sepolia.mantle.xyz/) to the Sepolia Mantle testnet.

## Optimisim

Optimism recommends the [Optimism Sepolia faucet](https://faucet.quicknode.com/optimism/sepolia) for this.

If you already have Sepolia ETH, you can deposit it by sending it to the Optimism Portal on
L1 Sepolia. See [Optimism Docs](https://community.optimism.io/docs/useful-tools/networks/#op-sepolia).

## Palm

PALM is the native token for the PALM ecosystem and is required to cover transaction costs on the network. Visit
[Get PALM Tokens](https://docs.palm.io/get-started/tokens) page on PALM networks documentation site to learn how to
obtain PALM tokens. 

When PALM tokens are available in your account, you are able to pay for the deployment of smart
contracts and for the transactions made on the Palm network.

## Polygon

You can obtain test tokens for the Amoy testnet by using the [official Polygon faucet](https://faucet.polygon.technology/).

:::info

You must be a member of the Polygon Discord community to obtain tokens.

:::

1. Visit the [Polygon Faucet](https://faucet.polygon.technology/)
1. Connect your Discord.
1. Select **Polygon PoS (Amoy)**.
1. Enter your account address and confirm.

## StarkNet

Use the [StarkNet faucet](https://starknet-faucet.vercel.app/) to get StarkNet ETH for use on the
Starknet testnet (Sepolia).

Use the [StarkNet bridge (StarkGate)](https://starkgate.starknet.io/) to bridge ETH or DAI between
Ethereum mainnet and StarkNet mainnet. StarkGate requires a MetaMask wallet extension and a
StarkNet-compatible wallet (for example, ArgentX) installed in the user's browser.
